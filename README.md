# N423 â€” Homework 3: Local Storage

- Add a student with **name, age, phone, email, and classes (array)**.
- Store data in **localStorage**
- **Display** students in an organized, styled table.
- Buttons: **Add Student**, **Show All**, **Clear All**.

## How to use the site

- Fill out First Name, Last Name, Age, Phone, Email, Classes.
- For Classes, enter a comma-separated list
- Click Add Student to save the student and update the table.
- Click Show All to read everything from localStorage and render it.
- Click Clear All to remove all saved students
- Refresh the page to confirm the data persists (stored in localStorage).

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Because it uses `localStorage`, data persists in that browser.
